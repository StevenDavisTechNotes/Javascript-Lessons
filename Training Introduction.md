## Expectations 
* Bring your thinking caps.  
* Read-up on JavaScript outside of class.  I have talked with everyoneâ€™s manager.  I expect that they will encourage you to make the most of this opportunity.  Career Advancement is an important value of Arrowstreet Capital.
* Go through the exercises again afterwards.  This helps a lot to reinforce the learning, and to identify questions to bring back.
* Bring back questions!  This is about what you learn not me getting through all of the material.
