Provide some exposure to JavaScript.

## Format 
Bring your thinking caps.  I will be at the keyboard and layout the material, but you need to find the solutions.

## Session Plan
1.	Making a first Web UI, Web API, and Web API Testing
2.	Javascript Scopes, Closures, Variables, Common Mistakes

4.	Javascript Classes and Inheritance
5.	DOM and jQuery Programming
6.	Higher Level WebDev Frameworks

## Expectations 
* Bring your thinking caps.  
* Read-up on JavaScript outside of class.  I have talked with everyoneâ€™s manager.  I expect that they will encourage you to make the most of this opportunity.  Career Advancement is an important value of Arrowstreet Capital.
* Go through the exercises again afterwards.  This helps a lot to reinforce the learning, and to identify questions to bring back.
* Bring back questions!  This is about what you learn not me getting through all of the material.
